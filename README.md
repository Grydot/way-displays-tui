# way-displays-tui
A simple python based TUI to manage your way-displays config.


Requires way-display: https://github.com/alex-courtis/way-displays

I have only tested this on Arch Linux. I cannot say if it works on other distros.

Things to work on.
- Display Order.
- Arranging Displays.
- VRR, I have no displays that support VRR so I am unable to test fully.
